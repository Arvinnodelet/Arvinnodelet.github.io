Hey, I'm Arvin.

I spent 10 years as a drone PM, then started my own business just before the robotic vacuum industry took off — unfortunately, it didn’t make it.

Now, I'm building a new venture in lidar sensors and robotics.

No pretenses, no airs — just walking my own path, sword in hand.

Hope to meet you here. Let’s build the future of smart hardware together.
